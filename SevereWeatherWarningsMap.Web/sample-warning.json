The edge of the\nfog was located from around Rockridge in northern Polk County to\nLake George in northwestern Volusia county, impacting areas around\nThe Villages, Leesburg, Clermont, Astor, U.S. Highway 441, and\nthe Florida Turnpike. This fog is expected to spread east and\nsouth to the Orlando metro area and the I-4 corridor over the\nnext several hours, linger past sunrise, and eventually burn off\naround 9 AM.\n\nIf you will be out driving early this morning, prepare to\nencounter rapid reductions in visibility due to dense fog. When\ndriving in dense fog, slow down, use your low beam headlights, and\nleave plenty of driving distance between your car and the one in\nfront of you.\n\nIf the fog becomes more dense and widespread, then a Dense Fog\nAdvisory will be issued.",

Warm,\nmoisture laden air overrunning cold air in place across Southeast\nAlaska will result in accumulating snow for most of the panhandle.\nSnow is expected to spread across the region from the Northeast\nGulf Coast down through the panhandle Tuesday night through\nWednesday. 5-11 inches of snow is expected to fall during a\n24-hour period with potentially higher amounts possible. The\nhighest totals are expected along the Northeast Gulf coast down\nto the Icy Strait corridor including Juneau, then extending down\nalong the areas west of the Coastal mountains. Rain is expected to\nmix in across parts of the central and southern panhandle limiting\nsnow accumulations.",

Precipitation across southeast Michigan for\nthe past 180 days has been below normal putting most of southeast Michigan\nin a moderate to severe drought. Slightly above normal precipitation since\nthe last outlook has improved the drought slightly.\n\n...RIVER CONDITIONS...\nRecent above normal precipitation mostly in the liquid form has increased the\nthe base flows to more around average to slightly below. Rivers are mostly ice\nfree with some light shorelince ice in areas.\n\n...SOIL CONDITIONS AND FROST DEPTH...\nRecent rainfall and snow melt has raised the soil moisture in the upper zones\nbut remain below average in the lower zones.  Frost depth ranges from zero to\na couple of inches across the area.  Well below average for this time of the\nWinter.\n\n...SNOW COVER AND LIQUID WATER CONTENT...\nSnow cover is basically zero to a trace south of the I69 corridor with a light\ncoating of ice from the recent ice storm. Along and north of the I 69 corridor\nthe recent storm put down an increasing snowpack northward from a couple inches\nto almost 10 in the far northern Thumb and Mildand area.  Water content in the\nrecent snow pack ranges from about half to an inch.\n\n...WEATHER OUTLOOK...\nThe outlook for the next 8-14 days calls for above average temperatures\nand above normal precipitation. The outlook for the Spring is for near to above\nnormal temperatures and above normal precipitation.\n\n...FLOOD SUMMARY OUTLOOK...\nEven with above normal precipitation since the first outlook, the area has improved\nslightly but still remains in moderate to severe drought.  The potential for Spring\nflooding is still below average.  At this point any flooding will be driven soley by\nexcessive rainfall events. Ice jam threat is non-existent.\n\nThe next and last Spring flood probabilistic outlook will be March 9.\n\nAdditional supportive data and explanations are available on the\ninternet at WWW.CRH.NOAA.GOV/DTX",
